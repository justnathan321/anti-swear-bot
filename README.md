# About
Simple and handy bot to keep your Discord text channels swear-free!

# How it works
The bot will check if a sentence contains a word that is listed as a bad word.
All swearing words are case insensitive.

In your Discord server:
- ASB add [word] to add a word that should be censored.
- ASB show all to get an overview of all censored words.

3. In main.py, change the token to your Discord bot token
4. Add the bot to your Discord server
